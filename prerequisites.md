# Prerequisites

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Prepare your development environment for the upcoming DevOps labs by installing necessary tools and setting up required accounts.

## Installations

### Code Editor: Visual Studio Code
As you embark on this DevOps journey, having a reliable code editor is essential. I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), a free and highly versatile code editor. Visual Studio Code supports a wide range of extensions and integrations, making it a powerful tool for development and DevOps tasks.

1. Download Visual Studio Code: Visit the [Visual Studio Code download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) page and select the version appropriate for your operating system.
2. Install Extensions: Consider installing extensions for Docker, Terraform, and Azure for an enhanced development experience.

### Terraform

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Ensure that you have Terraform installed on your machine.

Download Terraform: Visit the [Terraform downloads](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) page and select the appropriate version for your operating system.

### Docker
Docker is essential for creating, deploying, and running applications using containers. For building Docker images, you will need Docker Desktop.

1. Download Docker Desktop: Visit the [Docker Desktop download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) page and select the version for Windows or macOS.
2. Install Docker Desktop: Follow the installation instructions to set up Docker Desktop on your machine. Ensure that Docker is running correctly by running docker --version in your terminal.


## Azure setup

To follow along with this tutorial, an Azure account is required. Azure provides a range of cloud services that are essential for many DevOps practices.

1. Create an Azure Account: If you don't already have an account, you can sign up for a free 12-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/search/?&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwtrSLBhCLARIsACh6RmiaUvnIcRuC0BE8HVqtnC09Za6Y_ByYHH8Z4qHmK5-inXXdgZB3d1EaAh8EEALw_wcB:G:s&OCID=AID2200274_SEM_Cj0KCQjwtrSLBhCLARIsACh6RmiaUvnIcRuC0BE8HVqtnC09Za6Y_ByYHH8Z4qHmK5-inXXdgZB3d1EaAh8EEALw_wcB:G:s&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtrSLBhCLARIsACh6RmiaUvnIcRuC0BE8HVqtnC09Za6Y_ByYHH8Z4qHmK5-inXXdgZB3d1EaAh8EEALw_wcB).

2. Understand Azure Costs: Please note that the DevOps The Hard Way tutorial may incur costs, as some Azure services used are not covered under the free tier. To better understand potential costs, consult the Azure Pricing Calculator [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/calculator/). Familiarise yourself with the pricing model to avoid unexpected charges.

3. [Set Up Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/): The Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a set of commands used to create and manage Azure resources. Install the Azure CLI by following the instructions here.

4. Configure Your Azure Environment: After installing the Azure CLI, sign in to your Azure account using `az login` and follow the prompts to authenticate.

## Additional Resources

To enhance your understanding and make the most out of this lab, consider exploring the following resources:

- Terraform Documentation: Comprehensive guides and references for using Terraform can be found [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs).
- Docker Documentation: Detailed documentation and tutorials for Docker are available [here](https://docs.docker.com/).
- Azure Documentation: Extensive documentation for all Azure services is accessible [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=popular).

By ensuring these prerequisites are met, you will be well-prepared to proceed with the lab and delve deeper into the world of DevOps.
