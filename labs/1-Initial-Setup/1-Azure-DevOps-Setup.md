#### üí° Pro Tip: Use clear, descriptive project names and descriptions to help team members understand the project's purpose at a glance.

## Azure Workload Identity Federation
Using a Workload Identity Federation is considered best practice for DevOps within your CI/CD pipeline. It serves as an identity to authenticate within your Azure Subscription, allowing you to deploy the relevant Terraform code.

1. To begin creation, within your newly created Azure DevOps Project ‚Äì select **Project Settings**
2. Select **Service Connections**
3. Select **Create Service Connection** -> **Azure Resource Manager** -> **Workload Identity federation (Automatic)**
4. Enter subscription/resource group to where service connection will be created. Create with relevant service connection name

- Confirm the assigned role in Azure subscription

### üß† Knowledge Check:
- Why is Workload Identity Federation considered best practice for DevOps CI/CD pipelines?
- What role does the Service Principal play in Azure resource deployment?

#### üí° Pro Tip: Regularly review and update the permissions assigned to your Workload Identity to maintain the principle of least privilege.

You are now all set and ready to deploy to Azure using Azure DevOps!
