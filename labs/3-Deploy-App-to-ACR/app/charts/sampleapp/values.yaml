  # Optionally specify a set of secret objects whose values
  # will be injected as environment variables by default.
  # You should add this section to a file like secrets.yaml
  # that is explicitly NOT committed to source code control
  # and then include it as part of your helm install step.

resources: {}
  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.

  #  cpu: 100m
  #  memory: 128Mi
  # requests:
